The scripts in this repository contain the basic implementation (Matlab) for kernel dictionary learning and sparsity priors based white matter clustering approaches proposed in above paper. 

 Specifically: we have included implementations for 
 1) kernel sparse clustering (L-0 norm prior) 
 2) kernelized k-means 
 3) group sparse kernel dictionary learning (Group sparsity prior)
 4) kernel dictionary learning with manifold prior (Laplacian prior)
 5) Evaluation measures: Rand Index and variants + Silhouette (SI) measure
